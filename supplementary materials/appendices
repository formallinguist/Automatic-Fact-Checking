##Computational Resources
All experiments are run on A100 GPUs. The runtime for each experiment varies as follows:
Simple Prompting takes two hours each, while Automatic Scraping
takes two and half hours. Naive RAG experiments require four hours for English and six
hours for Telugu to complete, whereas Advanced RAG takes six hours for English and eight
hours for Telugu to complete.

# Inter Annotation Guidelines

## 1. Guidelines for True and False Labels

### Objective
Determine if the claim is factually accurate based on the supporting document. Annotators are instructed to assign one of two labels: **True** or **False**, following the below guidelines.

---

### Rules for Labels

#### **True**
- The claim is directly supported by the fact-checking article or news article and discussed in the gold justification.  
- Minor phrasing differences (e.g., *"helped identify clusters"* vs. *"detected clusters"*) are acceptable.  
- Claims with accurate numbers/dates (e.g., *"55,342 cases"*) are considered True even if the wording varies.  

**Example:**  
- **Claim:** "WHO praises India’s Aarogya Setu app for identifying clusters."  
- **Justification:** "WHO Director-General acknowledged the app’s role in identifying clusters (Source X)."  
- **Label:** **True**

---

#### **False**
- The False claim is supported by fact-checking sources.  
- The supporting document provides sufficient evidence (from the fact-checking article).  
- The claim contains fabricated or incorrect information, as discussed in the fact-checking article and gold justifications.  
- **Partially True Claims:** Label as **False** if the claim is misleading despite containing partial truth, as outlined in the fact-checking article and gold justification.  

**Example:**  
- **Claim:** "COVID-19 cases dropped to 55,342 due to improved recovery rates."  
- **Gold Justification:** "The claim is False because the supporting document X says COVID-19 cases dropped to 45,000 and there is a high recovery rate."  
  *(Fact-checking article label: Partially True / Misleading / Partially False)*  
- **Label:** **False** (as it spreads misinformation)

---

## 2. Boolean Answers (Yes/No)

### Direct QA Pairs

**Objective:** Answer Yes/No questions based strictly on the claim and supporting document.

- **Yes:**  
  If the claim is **True**, and the question directly reflects the claim, and the supporting document agrees with it.  

- **No:**  
  If the claim is **False**, and the question directly reflects the claim, and the supporting document agrees with it.  

---

### In-Direct QA Pairs

**Objective:** Answer Yes/No questions based strictly on the claim and supporting document.

- **Yes:**  
  If the supporting document confirms a corrective or related question that helps show the claim is **False**.  

- **No:**  
  If the supporting document contradicts the question and supports the original claim is **True**.
