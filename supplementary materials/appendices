##Computational Resources
All experiments are run on A100 GPUs. The runtime for each experiment varies as follows:
Simple Prompting takes two hours each, while Automatic Scraping
takes two and half hours. Naive RAG experiments require four hours for English and six
hours for Telugu to complete, whereas Advanced RAG takes six hours for English and eight
hours for Telugu to complete.
